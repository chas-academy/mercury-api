```

## Quickstart
It's best if this is started from the project root instead of inside the api repo, but if for some reason you want to work on the API independently you can run the project from this location. Here's how to do that:

Note: Only change the environment variables for `POSTGRES_USER` and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` if working on local machine.

Copy `.env.dist` to `.env` and change the values of the environment variables if needed.

```
PORT=7770
ALLOW_ORIGIN=http://localhost:7771
JWT_SECRET=jwtsecretcode
POSTGRES_PORT=5432
POSTGRES_DB=api
POSTGRES_USER=user
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=root
```

Then run the following commands:

```
yarn
yarn start
```

Note: The database must be created and initialized after starting the app on fresh installation.
See **Database using PostgreSQL and Sequelize** section. See **Bash Commands** section for Docker.

Access the app at <http://localhost:7770>.

# Usage

## Docker

Download and install the [Docker Community Edition](https://www.docker.com/community-edition).

Note: See **Bash Commands** section for Docker.

## Database using PostgreSQL and Sequelize

**Installing PostgreSQL**

**Mac:** [Getting Started with PostgreSQL on Mac OSX](https://www.codementor.io/engineerapart/getting-started-with-postgresql-on-mac-osx-are8jcopb)
<br>
**Windows:** [Installing PostgreSQL, Creating a User, and Creating a Database](https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONF30/Database+Setup+for+PostgreSQL+on+Windows)

NOTE: For Mac users, you can run the PostgreSQL server on a separate terminal console by running the following command:

```
postgres -D /usr/local/var/postgres
```

**Create and Initialize Database**

Open a terminal console and run the following commands:

```
sequelize db:create
sequelize db:migrate
sequelize db:seed:all
```

To drop database, run the following command:

```
sequelize db:drop
```

See **Bash Commands** section for Docker.

## Bash Commands

On the `root` directory of the project, run the following commands:

Note: To view the Docker containers, open another terminal console then enter `docker ps`.
To manage separate Docker instance for API, open another terminal console and run the commands below.

### Docker

| Command                                | Description                                                        |
|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `./bin/install`                        | Build the Docker containers, initialise database and start the app |
| `./bin/reinstall`                      | Re-build containers, re-initialise database and start the app      |
| `./bin/start`                          | Start all the services (API and database)                          |
| `./bin/stop`                           | Stop all the services                                              |
| `./bin/console <container ID or Name>` | Access the terminal console of the API container                   |

### Database

**Local**

| Command                               | Description                                                |
|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `./bin/pg/local/start`                | Start the PostgreSQL server (for Mac users only)           |
| `./bin/pg/local/resetdb`              | Drop and re-initialise database                            |
| `./bin/pg/local/migrate`              | Run new schema migration                                   |
| `./bin/pg/local/migrateundo`          | Revert the recent schema migration                         |
| `./bin/pg/local/seed <seed file>`     | Run specific data seed file with or without .js extension  |
| `./bin/pg/local/seedundo <seed file>` | Revert the seed of specific data seed file                 |
| `./bin/pg/local/psql`                 | Access the database console                                |

**Docker**

- To run the commands for Docker database service, simply remove the `local` from the command
- The `start` command works only in local machine
- Used `./bin/pg/psql <database container ID or Name>` to access the database console

## Users

Use the following credentials to test different API responses. Default password for all accounts is `password`.

| Name              | Email                  | Description |
|-------------------|------------------------|-------------|
| Super Admin User  | `superadmin@email.com` | Has wildcard access |
| Admin User        | `admin@email.com`      | Has wildcard access but `Admin › Users › Delete` is excluded |
| Common User       | `user@email.com`       | Can access `My Profile`, `Admin › Dashboard`, `Users`, `Users › View, and Settings` |
| Referrer User     | `referrer@email.com`   | When `redirect` is set without the domain, e.i. `/admin/dashboard`, user shall be redirected to internal page if no location path (referrer) found on the Sign In page |
| Redirect User     | `redirect@email.com`   | When `redirect` is set with complete URL, e.i. `https://github.com/anthub-services`, user shall be redirected to external page if no location path (referrer) found on the Sign In page |
| Blocked User      | `blocked@email.com`    | User is signed in but the account is blocked |
| Unauthorized User | `<any invalid email>`  | Simply enter wrong `email` and/or `password` |

## How to create migrations, models and seeds with as little bs as possible

Use yarn and sequelize-cli to ensure everything is created uniformly.

- Generate model

`yarn sequelize model:generate --name ModelName --attributes firstAttribute:string,secondAttribute:integer`

This will create a model called ModelName and a corresponding migration-file.

- Migrate

`yarn sequelize db:migrate`

This will create database-tables based on the migration-files.

- Generate seed

If you want to add demo-data to your new table, you need to make a seed.

`yarn sequelize seed:generate --name ModelNames`

- Seed database

`yarn sequelize db:seed:all`

This will seed all tables with their seeds. 

- Troubleshooting

You can drop and re-create the database if you screwed up.

`yarn sequelize db:drop`

`yarn sequelize db:create`
